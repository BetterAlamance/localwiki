API Documentation
=================

LocalWiki provides a RESTful, read/write API with advanced geospatial
capabilities.  Reading (using ``GET`` requests) is allowed for all users,
but to write (``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, ``DELETE``) you'll need to generate an API
key.

The LocalWiki API follows the conventions of `Tastypie <https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie>`_.  If this documentation seems incomplete, refer to Tastypie's page on `Interacting with the API <http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/interacting.html>`_ to become familiar with the common idiom.

.. note::

    You will probably want to try these URLs in your browser. In order to make them work in a browser, you'll need to append the ``format`` query string parameter.  For example, to view the `page` resource list, you'll want visit a URL like this::

    /api/page/?format=json

Unless otherwise specified, all endpoints that return lists support the ``limit`` and ``offset`` parameters for pagination. Pagination information is contained in the embedded ``meta`` object within the response.


API versioning
==============

The LocalWiki API sends API version information in the ``Content-type``
header.  For instance, ``Content-Type: application/vnd.api.v1+json; charset=utf-8``

You can lock your application to a particular version of the
API by sending an ``Accept`` header with an appropriate version string.
For instance, ``Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`` will request
version 1 of the API.


Formats
=======

This documentation gives examples in ``json``.  However, the API also supports the ``xml``, ``yaml``, ``jsonp``, and ``plist`` (binary plist) formats.  The ``jsonp`` format takes an optional ``callback`` querystring.


API Examples
============

To get a handle on how to interact with the API, and how to
use the filtering system, see the `api examples <api_examples>`_.

Resources
=========

Site
----

The Site object can be queried to retrieve information about the LocalWiki instance.

Example Site object:

.. code-block:: javascript

        {
            "domain": "TallahasseeWiki.org", 
            "id": 1, 
            "language_code": "en-us", 
            "license": "<p>Except where otherwise noted, this content is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. See <a href=\"/Copyrights\">Copyrights.</p>", 
            "name": "TallahasseeWiki.org", 
            "resource_uri": "/api/site/1/", 
            "signup_tos": "I agree to release my contributions under the <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons-By license</a>, unless noted otherwise. See <a href=\"/Copyrights\" target=\"_blank\">Copyrights</a>.", 
            "time_zone": "America/Chicago"
        }

Users
-----

User objects can be queried to retrieve information about LocalWiki users. Emails, passwords, etc are not included in responses.

Example User object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "date_joined": "2012-06-13T12:10:52", 
        "first_name": "Tanya", 
        "last_name": "Schaad",

Pages
-----

Pages are the base objects in a LocalWiki.  Pages contain, among other
things, a ``content`` field consisting of a special subset of HTML5
markup.

Example Page object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "content": "<p>Bradfordville Blues Club experience is like no other. It combines a truly unique location and atmosphere with the best the Blues has to offer. </p>",
        "id": 158, 
        "map": "/api/map/Bradfordville_Blues_Club", 
        "name": "Bradfordville Blues Club", 
        "page_tags": "/api/page_tags/Bradfordville_Blues_Club", 
        "resource_uri": "/api/page/Bradfordville_Blues_Club", 
        "slug": "bradfordville blues club"
    }

Create
~~~~~~

To create a new page, POST a JSON document containing at least the ``name`` and ``content`` properties to /api/page/. Other properties such as ``map`` may also be set.


Update
~~~~~~

To update an existing page, PUT a JSON document containing all the resource attributes to /api/page/[name].  You may also update a single field in a page by issuing a PATCH to /api/page/[name] with just the relevant field (e.g. ``content``).


Delete
~~~~~~

To delete an existing page, issue a DELETE to /api/page/[name].


Maps
----

Maps are collections of geographic data that are associated with a given
page.  Maps contain ``points``, ``lines``, and ``polys`` fields, each
containing `GeoJSON <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON>`_
(or an XML/format-specific equivalent).  Maps also contain a ``length``
field, which you do not need to manually provide when issuing POSTs.

The ``geom`` field is a collection of the
``points``, ``lines`` and ``polys`` fields.  Sometimes it's convient to
use this all-in-one field, though we cannot filter using the ``geom``
field.

Example Map object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "geom": {
            "geometries": [
                {
                    "coordinates": [
                        -84.292406, 
                        30.448938999999999
                    ], 
                    "type": "Point"
                }
            ], 
            "type": "GeometryCollection"
        }, 
        "id": 2, 
        "length": 0.0, 
        "lines": null, 
        "page": "/api/page/IFS_Business_Interiors", 
        "points": {
            "coordinates": [
                [
                    -84.292406, 
                    30.448938999999999
                ]
            ], 
            "type": "MultiPoint"
        }, 
        "polys": null, 
        "resource_uri": "/api/map/IFS_Business_Interiors"
    }

::

Create
~~~~~~

To create a new map, POST a JSON document containing at least a ``geom`` attribute and a ``page`` attribute.  ``geom`` should be a `GeoJSON GeometryCollection <http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`_ and ``page`` should be an api-relative URI of a ``page`` resource.  Instead of providing the ``geom`` attribute you may instead provide one or more of the ``points`` (MultiPoint), ``lines`` (MultiLineString) and ``polys`` (MultiPolygon) properties.

Update
~~~~~~

To update an existing map, PUT a JSON document containing all the resource attributes to /api/map/[pagename].  You may also update a single field in a page by issuing a PATCH to /api/map/[pagename] with just the relevant field (e.g. ``points``).


Delete
~~~~~~

To delete an existing map, issue a DELETE to /api/map/[pagename].


Tags
----

Tags are simple keywords associated with pages.  With tags, there are
two resources you'll be interested in using:  ``tag`` and
``page_tags``.  The ``tag`` resource represents the global *tag*
that may be used on many different pages.  ``page_tags`` are the tags
associated with a particular page.

A ``tag`` is represented by a ``name`` and a ``slug`` (name without
spaces and other characters).

Example Tag object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "id": 71, 
        "name": "coffee shop", 
        "resource_uri": "/api/tag/coffeeshop/", 
        "slug": "coffeeshop"
    }

Schema

List
~~~~

::

    http://localhost:8000/api/tag/

Fetch
~~~~~

::

    http://localhost:8000/api/tag/[slug]/

Create
~~~~~~

To create a new ``tag``, POST a JSON document containing at least a
``slug`` attribute to /api/tag/.

Update
~~~~~~

You cannot currently update a tag.


Delete
~~~~~~

You cannot currently delete a tag.

Page Tags
---------

``page_tags`` are the particular set of ``tags`` associated with a given
``page``.

A ``page_tags`` resource is represented by a ``page`` API URI and a ``tags``
attribute, which is a list of ``tag`` URIs.

Example PageTags object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "id": 2, 
        "page": "/api/page/Lake_Ella", 
        "resource_uri": "/api/page_tags/Lake_Ella", 
        "tags": [
            "/api/tag/lakes/", 
            "/api/tag/parks/", 
            "/api/tag/recreation/"
        ]
    }

List
~~~~

::

    http://localhost:8000/api/page_tags/

Fetch
~~~~~

::

    http://localhost:8000/api/page_tags/[pagename]

Create
~~~~~~

To create a new ``page_tags`` set, POST a JSON document containing at least a
``page`` attribute (path to a ``page`` resource) and a ``tags``
attribute (a list of paths to ``tag`` resources).

**Note** that all the ``tag`` resources you specify **must already exist**.
If they don't exist yet you'll want to create them first with a POST to
the ``tag`` endpoint.

Update
~~~~~~

To update an existing ``page_tags`` set, PUT a JSON document all the
resource attributes to /api/page_tags/[pagename].

**Note** that all the ``tag`` resources you specify **must already exist**.
If they don't exist yet you'll want to create them first with a POST to
the ``tag`` endpoint.

Delete
~~~~~~

To delete a ``page_tags`` set, issue a DELETE to
/api/page_tags/[pagename].
