``django-versionutils``
===============================================

``django-versionutils`` is a collection of reusable Django apps designed
to provide everything you need to do robust, smart and extendable versioning,
diffing and merging when working with Django.

The ``django-versionutils`` project was initially developed for the `LocalWiki
project`_.  We found that existing versioning systems for Django didn't
suit our needs (and often left much to be desired).
