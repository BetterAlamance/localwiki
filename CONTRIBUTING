Email patches to philip@localwiki.org or post them to the LocalWiki development mailing list (http://lists.localwiki.org)

  1. Discuss large changes on the mailing list or trac before coding.
  2. Python code style should follow PEP8 standards whenever possible (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
  3. Agree to the contributor agreement (<URL HERE>).

Please also see our ticketing system at http://code.trac.localwiki.org/.  Picking out some tickets to work on is a great way to get started on the project!

Come talk to us in the #localwiki IRC channel on freenode.net!  Because the project is just getting started, things are moving rather quickly.  IRC is a great way to quickly chat about functionality and plans!
